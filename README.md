# Sirius Systems
Brilliance in every Byte

## Stork Dork
Stork Dork is a user focused web-application that will allow bird hobbyists both beginner and experienced, to find bird and region information, log and track birding milestones, and interact with each other. Our purpose is to provide birders an easy to use app, where they can share their finds and learn more about the birds they spot. Weâ€™re proposing this topic because while birding is a niche community, it's full of passionate birders and is constantly growing. While there are existing competitors such as Merlin and eBird, Dork Stork will have a larger focus on user milestones and social interaction. Users can earn badges based on their finds, and display them on their profile, providing a sense of accomplishment.

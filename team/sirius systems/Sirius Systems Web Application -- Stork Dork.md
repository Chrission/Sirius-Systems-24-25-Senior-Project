# Stork Dork

The purpose of this web application is for users to learn about and explore bird species. The application will allow users to search the bird by name or their family and features about a bird (color, height, weight). Then they will be able to get detailed information about the birds. This will include their region/habitat, migration patterns, flock information and more. Users will be able to create profiles and join communities. Users will also be able to create birdwatching lists, share information about birds, share tips and track their sightings with the community.

## 3 Main Features:

- Being able to search bird/region information
- Social interaction/community
- Bird logger for the user

## What is its purpose?

The purpose of this web application is to allow bird enthusiasts to connect with each other and share their information such as: sightings and different bird species. Users will be able to log their information, allowing for a fun birding experience _for everyone_.

## Why Are You Proposing This Topic?

We proposed this topic because birding is a popular and **growing** hobby and this will allow for users to connect and engage online with other enthusiasts to share their info with others. Birding is a niche hobby and it has a passionate community. By creating an application that allows for them to share findings online, log their information and create profiles, it could serve as a way for them to connect.

## Existing Competitors:

- Some of the existing competitors include: eBird, iNaturalist, Seek and Merlin Bird ID.
- Our application has social interaction and it also includes elements of tracking user milestones and accomplishments. Another way we can stand out is allowing users to earn badges/achievements from birdwatching challenges, giving users a sense of accomplishment. This allows for a more gratifying experience.

## List of Features:

### Features for the Application:

- Tracking bird related _progress milestones_ based on number of species spotted, region information plotted and more.
- Ability to view bird specific maps, containing location information, spotting frequency, and season/weather related data that may effect bird spotting patterns.
- Ability to view timlines of a region, to see how local seasons and weather may effect the areas in which birds are spotted / relocate.
- The ability to search for region and bird information, present bird data in a _digestible_ and consistent format.
- The ability to share bird information, such as local spottings, flock number estimations, and local weather conditions at the time of spotting.

### User Needs:

- Bird Logging System

### System Needs:

### Problems Solved:

- Creates a space for bird hobbyists both veteran and beginner to learn about local bird populations in an _intuitive_ and friendly manner.
- Provides the users a way to share their finds with other members of the community, and display achievements on their profile to showcase their finds. (Think a special badge for spotting 10+ Herons arouns Salem for example)
- Combines weather and seasonal data with bird information to present the user with _digestible_ information about how the current weather may effect their bird spotting within the region.

## Vision Statement

Stork Dork is a user focused web-application that will allow bird hobbyists both beginner and experienced, to find bird and region information, log and track birding milestones, and interact with each other. Our purpose is to provide birders an easy to use app, where they can share their finds and learn more about the birds they spot. Weâ€™re proposing this topic because while birding is a niche community, it's full of passionate birders and is constantly growing. While there are existing competitors such as Merlin and eBird, Dork Stork will have a larger focus on user milestones and social interaction. Users can earn badges based on their finds, and display them on their profile, providing a sense of accomplishment.

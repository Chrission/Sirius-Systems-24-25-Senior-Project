Our purpose is to provide birders an easy to use app, where they can share their finds and learn more about the birds they spot. Weâ€™re proposing this topic because while birding is a niche community, it's full of passionate birders and is constantly growing. While there are existing competitors such as Merlin and eBird, Dork Stork will have a larger focus on user milestones and social interaction. Users can earn badges based on their finds, and display them on their profile, providing a sense of accomplishment.

##### Birding

- Birding is a hobby that many enjoy, so it would be useful to have an application that could list information about birds (i.e. Habitat, seasonal migrations, and bird calls). Xeno-canto contains audio recordings of birds that give users an idea of what they sound like. The user can search for birds they are interested in, or explore different families of birds through the site. There may also be a section with the most recent (or nearest) bird sighting collected through eBird.

  

##### Weather & Air Quality

- A webapp designed to display weather data and air quality readings for users in their local area. The web app will give users warnings about bad air quality, and allow them to view historical weather data in their area to compare to current weather trends. It will also provide an upcoming weather forecast. There will be aggregated data based on how weather trends have changed over the years, that is displayed neatly for the user to view. This is intended to provide insight into how the area they live in has been changing, and help them prepare for current weather trends.

  

##### Social Forum

- A webapp designed for people with common interests to come together and find each other. The app will allow users to make forums and be connected with one another and ultimately, make friends. Users will be able to interact with each other and chat through forums and join different communities based on what interests them. Also, users can create their own forum pages and create communities of their own. The owner of the forum will be able to monitor users' messages and interactions with people to ensure there is no foul play or bad behavior.
